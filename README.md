# VScode
VS Code is a workspace which collected one or more folders. Most of the time, having a single folder opened as the workspace. VScode is not a IDE, is a text editor.

Visual Studio Code is a free, lightweight, and extensible code editor for building web, desktop, and mobile applications, using any programming language and framework.

Visual Studio Code has built-in support for Git source control management and powerful integrations with GitHub, an integrated debugger, and smart code completion with IntelliSense and with AI-driven IntelliCode. With over 30,000 extensions and themes in the Visual Studio Code Marketplace, you can customize the features and the look of Visual Studio Code to fit your needs, preferences, and style.

You can use Visual Studio Code to build any kind of app, for web, desktop, and mobile. Visual Studio Code supports JavaScript and TypeScript natively and offers extensions for coding in languages such as Python, Java, C/C++, C#, Go, Rust, PHP, and many more.

    - start your coding now
    - click run button on the top-right corner of the editor
    - output will appear in the Terminal or Debug Console
5. Create a Maven project in Terminal
    - cd to your location
    - run `mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=my-maven-project -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false`
    - check the folder structer after build success
    - open floder on VScode
    - Adding Dependencies to the Project: modify pom.xml
    - start your coding now
    - cd to pom.xml located
    - run `mvn compile` to compile the project
    - run `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.App"` to execute the code
    - output should display now

* [mavenSearch](https://mvnrepository.com/) : e.g:input `testNg` on search field.

Troubleshooting:
- Maven not Recognized: check Maven was added to systme Path
- Dependency Issues: check the pom.xml file
